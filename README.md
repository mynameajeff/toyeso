# The Toyeso Lang
A toy esoteric language project created by mynameajeff.

The Toyeso Spec:

Short Description:

    - A toy esoteric language project created by mynameajeff.

The aim of this language:

    ~ "To look similar to ASM/lower level langs, 
        but have functionality more similar to python, 
        including my own personal tweaks. " - mynameajeff

The Rules of the lang:

    - Every program must begin with a START statement.

    - Every program must end with an END statement.

    - Capitals are optional for keywords & variable names,
        but are not for types and the special char (i)

    - Before the START statement, (which must 
        occupy the first five character spaces of a line),
        commmenting is allowed because, the interpreter 
        will not have begun scanning for syntax. This also
        means no code will be recognised here.

    - After the END statement, (same thing as START but three)
        you may comment once again, because the interpreter will
        have terminated and is therefore not scanning for syntax anymore.

    - In the event you want to comment within the codespace(start-end)
        you could use the special character "~",
        either on it's own line,
        or at the end of another.
        
    - Type is implemented with variables(not in the Imem)
        what is currently implemented: string, bool, int, float,
        they are stored, and can be accessed via the AOUT command.
        
    - The special characters are these:

        @: this one means 'from var', so @"variable" literally means 'from var named variable'
        
        i: this one means 'from constant variable store at index',
                so i0 literally means 'from constant variable store at index 0'

        $: this one means 'direct value', so $33 literally means 'direct value'
        
        all of them work with the command to create the final product of that command.

There are a few keywords, I'll list them now.

    const:
        stores constant number in the Imemory
        where the next index is available.

        Example: const 55

    decl:
        @: <not implemented>

        i: <not implemented>

        $:
            creates a variable(of type given after :)
            with the name given within the "'s 
            and the value given after the $.

            Example: decl:float "variable" $54.63

    out:
        @: <not implemented>

        i: 
            This command will output the value stored at the index 
            in the Imemory specified by the number after the i,
            which is by default 0.

            Example: out i0

        $:
            This command will output the value specified by the number after the $.

            Example: out $22.5

    aout:
        @:  This command will look to the variable specified within the "'s,
            get the value and depending on the type, output it.
            
            Example: aout @"variable"

        i:  This command will output the ascii character
            represented by the number in the Imem at the index
            given after the i.
        
            Example: aout i0

        $: 
            This command will output the ascii character 
            represented by the number given after the $.

            Example: aout $65
